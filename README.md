NFig.Redis is a configuration/settings library which uses Redis to store configuration overrides and receive live-update notifications. It is built on top of [NFig](https://github.com/NFig/NFig).

NFig.Redis is a work in progress, and there is no documentation yet, but you can look at the [sample console app](https://github.com/NFig/NFig.Redis/tree/master/SampleApplication) to get a feel for how it works.
